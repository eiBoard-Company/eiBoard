## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the Iteration Test Plan is to gather all of the information necessary to plan and control the test effort for a given iteration. It describes the approach to testing the software.
This Test Plan for CommonPlayground supports the following objectives:

- Identifies the items that should be targeted by the tests.
- Identifies the motivation for and ideas behind the test areas to be covered.
- Outlines the testing approach that will be used.
- Identifies the required resources and provides an estimate of the test efforts.

### 1.2 Scope

This test plan will cover tests assuring the functionality of the application's front end, back end and the communication between the two.
This document shows the following types of testing:

- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- User Interface Testing
- API Testing

 Not covered are any tests related to performance and scale or usability.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

This test plan is written primarily for internal documentation reasons. It is meant to provide orientation to the developers to work from and as a documentation to measure the fullfillment of quality requirements against.

## 2. Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation

### 2.1 Background

Testing serves to ensure that the written code does what it is intended to do. It also prevents future code changes to break existing functionality unnoticed. In the context of integration it can also prevent broken software states to be merged into secured VC branches

### 2.2 Evaluation Mission

Testing is a crucial phase in the development cycle. It is necessary in order to fix technical bugs and important functional problems. With TDD we define the test first and can fix bugs before they even occur.

### 2.3 Test Motivators

The tests are done to ensure quality and mitigate risks and fulfill functional requirements. Their purpose is to provide stability for our application.

## 3. Target Test Items

- Android frontend
- Server backend (and APIs)

## 4. Outline of Planned Tests

### 4.1 Outline of Test Inclusions

*Frontend: Android Client*:

- UI testing of views/fragments
- Unit testing

*Backend: Spring Boot Application*:

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Api testing

![Testing overview](./testing_overview.png)  

The tests themself will not be tested and will not account into code coverage.

### 4.2 Outline of Other Candidates for Potential Inclusion

n/a

### 4.3 Outline of Test Exclusions

Because of time and resource constraints we will not do:

- Stress test
- Load/performance tests
- Usability tests
- any further tests

## 5. Test Approach

### 5.1 Testing Techniques and Types

#### 5.1.1 Unit Testing

Unit testing ensures, that the tested sourcecode works as expected. Therefore small parts of the sourcecode are tested independently.

|                       | Description                                                         |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Technique Objective    | Ensure that the implemented code works as expected                  |
|Technique              | Implement test methods using JUnit Framework (Frontend & Backend)   |
|Oracles                | Test execution logs results to the command line, logs in CI/CD Tool (Travis) |
|Required Tools         | JUnit 4 & 5 Dependencies in Frontend and Backend                    |
|Success Criteria       | All tests pass. Coverage is above 10% (Frontend) / 60% (Backend)    |
|                       | CI/CD Pipeline with test stages for Frontend and Backend: [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/nilskre/CommonPlayground)|
|Special Considerations | -                                                                   |

#### 5.1.2 User Interface Testing

By UI testing the application is tested from the perspective of the user. The goal of UI testing is to ensure that the UI behaves as expected.

|                       | Description                                                          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Technique Objective    | Test application automated from the perspective of the user through UI Test |
|Technique              | Writing Gherkin `.feature` files with clearly defined steps and the expected result. The test implementation of the steps use the Android Espresso library to serve the emulator. [Further information](https://commonplayground.wordpress.com/week-5-testing-with-cucumber//) |
|Oracles                | Expect that the steps of the test are executed successfully and the UI behaves as planned. Test execution logs results to the command line, logs in CI/CD Tool (Travis) |
|Required Tools         | Dependencies of Cucumber and Espresso (official Android UI test library) and an Implementation of a test runner based on JUnit 4 to execute UI tests with Cucumber and Espresso |
|Success Criteria       | All UI tests pass.
|                       | CI/CD Pipeline with test stages for Frontend and Backend: [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/nilskre/CommonPlayground)   |
|Special Considerations | - |

#### 5.1.3 Integration Testing (API Testing)

Api Testing is part of integration testing. Integration tests test multiple modules of an application together. The main goal of Api testing is to ensure, that the provided Apis of the Backend behave as expected.

|                       | Description                                                          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Technique Objective    | Test the provided Apis with Cucumber                                 |
|Technique              | For every meaningful api a Gherkin `.feature` exists and the steps are implemented.  |            |
|Oracles                | Test execution logs results to the command line, Logs in CI/CD Tool (Travis) |
|Required Tools         | JUnit, Cucumber, Rest assured, Hamcrest                                     |
|Success Criteria       | All tests pass. Coverage is above 60%                                |
|                       | CI/CD Pipeline with test stages for Frontend and Backend: [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/nilskre/CommonPlayground) |
|Special Considerations | -                                                                    |

## 7. Deliverables

## 7.1 Test Evaluation Summaries

The project owns a certain amount of tests in the Frontend and Backend. Each pushed commit triggers our CI/CD Pipeline, which builds the application and executes the tests. Furthermore a code analysis with Codacy is triggered. We use a monorepo which includes the docs and the sourcecode for our Backend and Frontend. That´s why we have one CI/CD Pipeline for our whole project. 

Continuous Integration/Delivery/Deployment Pipeline based on Travis CI: [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/nilskre/CommonPlayground) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nilskre/CommonPlayground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/nilskre/CommonPlayground)

## 7.2 Reporting on Test Coverage

For reporting our test coverage we use Jacoco and Codacy. 

Code Test Coverage: [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Coverage/7fdcfeca10b94f4c9b6bc1a809669c2b)](https://www.codacy.com/app/CommonPlayground/CommonPlayground?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=nilskre/CommonPlayground&utm_campaign=Badge_Coverage)

## 7.3 Perceived Quality Reports

The code quality tool is Codacy. [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/7fdcfeca10b94f4c9b6bc1a809669c2b)](https://www.codacy.com/app/CommonPlayground/CommonPlayground?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=nilskre/CommonPlayground&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

## 7.4 Incident Logs and Change Requests

We integrated the tools mentioned above into our GitHub pull request workflow. If a build fails this is directly visible in the PR. Furthermore the team is alerted by an email.
The screenshot shows the integration:

![GitHub PR integrated tools](./integrated_tools.png)

## 7.5 Smoke Test Suite and Supporting Test Scripts

The automated test execution in our CI/CD Pipeline enables regression testing. With this approach it is clearly visible when changes break existing functions and affect the correct behaviour of the application.

## 8. Testing Workflow

1) Local testing in the IDE
2) Commit and Push triggers build and test exection in the CI/CD Pipeline
3) Each PR triggers the pipeline (build and test)
4) Before the automated deployment the build and test stages are executed
